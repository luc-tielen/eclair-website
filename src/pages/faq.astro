		<dd class="text-lg pt-2">
			Eclair is inspired by <Link href="https://souffle-lang.github.io">Souffl√©</Link>,
			another high-performance Datalog. Because of the similarities, a different kind of
			food was chosen to stay in the same theme. Besides, an eclair contains both chocolate
			and pudding, what's not to like?

		<dt class="font-semibold text-xl pt-4">What license does Eclair have?</dt>

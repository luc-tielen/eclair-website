Eclair is a high-level declarative logic query language (a Datalog variant). At
first glance, it might not be immediately obvious how these kinds of programs
are executed. This page aims to explain step-by-step how each part of an
Eclair program is evaluated using some examples.

## Top-level facts

Top-level, hard-coded facts are the easiest to evaluate. When a fact is
encountered in a program, Eclair will add the fact to the corresponding
relation.

A fact will only be added to a relation if it contains new information; if a
fact with the same arguments was already present, the redundant information
will be discarded.

The facts that are hard-coded into the Eclair program will be combined with the
facts that are dynamically [added via the
API](/docs/api#serializing-data-from-host-language-to-eclair).

When evaluating the following snippet, two facts would be added to the
`example` relation.

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={`
@def example(u32, u32).

example(1, 2).
example(2, 3).
`} />

## Rules

For rules we make a distinction between non-recursive rules and recursive
rules, since they are evaluated in completely different ways.

### Non-recursive rules

Non-recursive rules are rules where none of the clauses in the rule body refer
to the relation in the rule head itself.

The simplest example of a non-recursive rule is a rule with a single clause:

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={`
@def a(u32) output.
@def b(u32, u32) input.

a(x) :-
  b(x, \_).
`} />

To evaluate the rule in the above example, Eclair will first search for all
facts of relation `b`. After that, it copies over the first column of each fact
in relation `b` to a new fact in relation `a`.

Things get slightly more complicated when a rule has multiple clauses. Take the
following code snippet:

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={`
@def a(u32, u32) output.
@def b(u32, u32) input.
@def c(u32, u32) input.

a(x, z) :-
  b(x, y),
  c(y, z).
`} />

In order to find all facts for relation `a`, Eclair first has to find all facts
in relation `b`. Then, it has to find all matching facts in relation `c` such
that the first column of `c` is equal to the second column of `b` (variables
with the same name add an implicit equality constraint!). Each time Eclair
finds a set of data that matches this pattern, it will add the result to the
relation `a`.

### Recursive rules

Now that we understand non-recursive rules, recursive rules are next. These are
rules where one of the clauses in the rule body refers to the same relation in
the rule head.

The main difference here is that this effectively means that Eclair will have
to keep applying the same rule over and over again in a loop until it no
longer can find any new information.

A good example of a recursive rule is the recursive case of the path example
used in a few other places on this website. Here's the relevant part of that
code:

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={`
@def edge(u32, u32).
@def reachable(u32, u32).

reachable(x, z) :-
  edge(x, y),
  reachable(y, z).
`} />

In order to evaluate this rule, Eclair will have to first have to find all
`edge` facts, and then look for matching `reachable` facts. If it finds new
facts, it will need to apply the same rule again.

**Important**: Eclair only takes into account facts derived from the last
iteration to avoid a lot of unnecessary computation. This technique is
called [semi-naive evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog#Semi-na%C3%AFve_evaluation).

You might notice that a recursive rule by itself can't result in any facts.
(There would be no facts to start the recursion from!) This is why a recursive
rule should always be paired with one or more non-recursive rules or top-level
facts.

## Stratification

So far, we've looked at the evaluation order of different situations one by
one. In a real program however, all these situations can occur simultaneously.

Eclair uses a **stratification** algorithm in order to evaluate a program in
the most optimal way. It does this by performing a topological sort of all
declarations, based on the dependencies between relations. Mutually recursive
relations are grouped together and evaluated in a single unit.

Stratification guarantees that rules are always executed in the same
deterministic order, using bottom-up evaluation. If a program can't be
stratified, the compiler will generate an error and abort compilation.

In the snippet below, the code would be evaluated in the following order:

1. First, the top-level facts are evaluated (facts have no data dependencies).
   The hard-coded facts are combined with facts added via the API.
2. Next, the non-recursive rule is evaluated, since it only depends on the
   `edge` relation.
3. Finally, the recursive rule is repeatedly evaluated until no new results can
   be found. (It has a dependency both on `edge` and `reachable`.)

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={`
@def edge(u32, u32) input.
@def reachable(u32, u32) output.

// Step 3
reachable(x, z) :-
  edge(x, y),
  reachable(y, z).

// Step 2
reachable(x, y) :-
  edge(x, y).

// Step 1
edge(1, 2).
edge(2, 3).
edge(3, 4).
`} />

## Wrapping up

It would take too long to explain each possible situation, but the previous
examples should have given you some intuition how programs are evaluated. You
can use the intermediate `RA` format (short for _relational algebra_) generated
by the compiler, if you want to know how eclair exactly evaluates your code.
You can generate `RA` output using the following command:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  code={`
$ eclair compile --emit ra program.eclair
`}
/>

This will print out the intermediary format as pseudo code to the screen and
will explain how Eclair code is evaluated using set semantics. (This is similar
to how evaluation was explained on this page.)

If we generate the `RA` pseudo-code for the last snippet from the previous
section, we get the output below. You can try comparing it with the previous
explanation:

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={`
project (3, 4) into edge
project (2, 3) into edge
project (1, 2) into edge

search edge as edge0 do
   project (edge0[0], edge0[1]) into reachable

merge reachable delta_reachable

loop do
purge new_reachable
search edge as edge0 do
  search delta_reachable as delta_reachable1 do
    if (edge0[0], delta_reachable1[1]) ∉ reachable do
      if edge0[1] = delta_reachable1[0] do
        project (edge0[0], delta_reachable1[1]) into new_reachable
  exit if counttuples(new_reachable) = 0
merge new_reachable reachable
swap new_reachable delta_reachable
`} />

The `RA` format should be seen as an advanced tool and is definitely not needed
all the time, but it can give you a greater understanding of what's exactly
happening under the hood.

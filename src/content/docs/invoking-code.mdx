title: Invoking Eclair code
---

import CodeBlock from "../../components/CodeBlock.tsx";

In this guide, we learn how to use the Eclair compiler to compile and run
Eclair programs to executable code. This tutorial assumes that
[eclair is already installed on your machine](/docs/getting-started).

In the commands on this page, `$ECLAIR` should be replaced with one of two options:

1. `eclair` if you installed eclair directly on your system,
2. `docker run --rm eclair:latest -v $(pwd):/code eclair` if you previously
   setup the eclair compiler via docker

## Discovering compiler commands and options

You can use the `-h` or `--help` flag to get more information about how to use
Eclair or one of it's subcommands:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  code={`
$ $ECLAIR -h
$ $ECLAIR compile -h
`}
/>

This can be a useful way to discover the different features of the Eclair
compiler.

## Compiling to LLVM

The `compile` subcommand can be used to compile Eclair programs to various
output formats using the `--emit` flag. The default format is LLVM IR, but each
of the internal representations during compilation can also be generated
(sometimes useful for understanding how the program will evaluate).

Given the following example Eclair program:

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={`
@def edge(from: u32, to: u32) input.
@def reachable(start: u32, end: u32) output.

reachable(x, y) :-
edge(x, y).

reachable(x, y) :-
edge(x, z),
reachable(z, y).
`} />

Then it can be compiled to LLVM IR with the following command:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  code={`
$ $ECLAIR compile --emit llvm path.eclair > path.ll
`}
/>

## Compiling to native executable code

After you have [compiled your program to LLVM](#compiling-to-llvm), you can use
all of the tooling from the LLVM framework (such as `clang`, `llc`, `opt`, ...).

For example, you can compile the generated LLVM file from the previous section
to an object file using the next command:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  code={`
$ clang -c -o path.o path.ll
# OR:
$ llc-14 -filetype=obj -o path.o path.ll
`}
/>

After that you can turn the object file into a static library archive:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  code={`
$ ar rcs path.a path.o
`}
/>

The section about [integrating with other languages](#integrating-with-other-languages)
will show how to link this library into a final executable.

## Compiling to WebAssembly

In order to run Eclair code compiled to WebAssembly, we first need to compile a
general-purpose allocator since none are provided in WASM. This is different
compared to the previous section where we could automatically re-use `malloc`
and `free` from the system-provided libc).

The code below shows how we can use [walloc](https://github.com/wingo/walloc)
to use a WASM-specific allocator in our Eclair code:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  code={`
# First we need to compile walloc.c
$ git clone https://github.com/wingo/walloc
$ cd walloc
$ clang --target=wasm32 -mbulk-memory -nostdlib -c -o walloc.o walloc.c
# Now we can compile the Eclair program and link it with walloc
$ $ECLAIR compile --target wasm32 path.eclair > path.ll
$ clang --target=wasm32 -mbulk-memory -nostdlib -c -o path.o path.ll
$ wasm-ld --no-entry --import-memory -o path.wasm path.o walloc.o
`}
/>

Note the use of the target flag to tell Eclair to generate WASM-specific code.
After running these commands, a `path.wasm` file that can be imported and
executed in Node.js or in a web browser.

## Integrating with other languages

Eclair is designed to be easily invoked from other languages. The Eclair
program runs in the same process as the other language (also referred to as the
_host language_). Data (in- and output facts) are send back and forth between
the languages via API calls.

The [runtime API](/docs/api) provided by Eclair provides all necessary
functionality, but is quite low-level and error-prone to use by hand. For this
reason, high-level language-specific bindings exist for the following languages
to make integration with Eclair much easier:

1. [Rust](#rust)
2. [Haskell](#haskell)
3. [Typescript and Javascript](#typescript-and-javascript)
4. [C](#c)

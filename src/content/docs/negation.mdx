title: Logical negation
---

import CodeBlock from "../../components/CodeBlock.tsx";

Besides conjunctions of multiple rule clauses (logical AND) and disjunctions of
multiple rules with the same name (logical OR), Eclair also supports negation
in rules (logical NOT). This makes it possible to write queries where you can
**search if a certain fact is not found**.

Here's an example that uses negation to find all recipes that are safe for
people who are lactose intolerant (can't contain any dairy products):

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={`
@def dairy_product(ingredient: string).
@def recipe_ingredients(recipe: string, ingredient: string).
@def lactose_safe_recipe(recipe: string).

lactose_safe_recipe(recipe) :-
  recipe_ingredients(recipe, ingredient),
  !dairy_product(ingredient).
`} />

## Restrictions

Negated rule clauses comes with a few restrictions, to guarantee that the
program is valid and will terminate. These are mostly related to [the way
programs are evaluated](/docs/evaluation).

A first limitation is that negated rule clauses do not
[ground](/docs/grounding) any of their arguments. This is due to how variables
are initialized in the final executable code generated by the compiler: if a
variable is ungrounded, it could potentially take on infinitely many values,
which is not allowed in Datalog. The fix for ungrounded variables is easy
though: ground the variable in another rule clause:

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={`
@def a(u32) output.
@def b(u32) input.
@def c(u32) input.
@def d(u32) input.

// This rule will not compile:
a(x, y) :-
  b(x),
  !c(y). // <-- y is not grounded

// This will:
a(x, y) :-
  b(x),
  d(y),  // <-- d grounds y, fixing the error
  !c(y).
`}/>

NOTE: Wildcards _are_ allowed in negated rule clauses (since they do not need to
be grounded).

A second restriction regarding negation is that you can't create "cyclic
negations" in rules. Cyclic negations can occur both for the case for rules
with direct cycles, and for multiple mutually recursive rules that contain
cycles referring to negated rule clauses.

An example of a direct cyclic negation is the following:

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={`
a(x) :-
  // ...
  !a(x).
`}/>

It is not possible to evaluate the above code because to evaluate `a`, we would
already need to know all results of `a`. (In other words, it is not possible to
stratisfy this program.)

An example of mutually recursive rules that contain cyclic negation can be
found below:

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={`
a(x) :-
  !b(x).

b(x) :-
  !a(x).
`}/>

The problem with the previous example is that to evaluate `a`, we would need to
have fully evaluated `b`, and `b` can't be computed until all results for
`a` have been calculated. This is again not a stratisfiable program.

This page contains installation instructions for various development tools that
can help with Eclair development.

## Editors

Right now there is support for Eclair in editors via editor-agnostic tools such
as [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) and
[LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/).
Editor-specific plugins or installation instructions might not be available
yet.

[Please open an issue on Github](https://github.com/luc-tielen/eclair-lang/issues)
or consider contributing!

## Syntax highlighting

There's a [tree-sitter grammar](https://github.com/luc-tielen/tree-sitter-eclair)
available for Eclair that can be used for syntax highlighting if your editor
supports it. It should work for any editor that supports syntax highlighting.

### Neovim

You can setup syntax highlighting in Neovim using the
[nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) package.
Run the following commands in your shell to add support for Eclair syntax
highlighting:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  code={`
$ git clone git@github.com:luc-tielen/tree-sitter-eclair.git && cd tree-sitter-eclair
$ npm install
$ ./node_modules/tree-sitter-cli/tree-sitter generate
$ ./node_modules/tree-sitter-cli/tree-sitter test
# The directory might be different based on your package manager.
# Here we are assuming "packer":
$ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/nvim-treesitter/queries/eclair
$ cp queries/highlights.scm ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/nvim-treesitter/queries/eclair/
`}
/>

Then, open Neovim and add the following code to your `init.lua`:

<CodeBlock
  language="lua"
  code={`
local parser_config = require "nvim-treesitter.parsers".get_parser_configs()
parser_config.eclair = {
  install_info = {
    -- Change directory to where you cloned the repo
    url = "/path/to/tree-sitter-eclair",
    files = {"src/parser.c"}
  }
}

vim.cmd 'au BufNewFile,BufRead \*.eclair set filetype=eclair'
`}
/>

Finally, switch to normal mode and run the following command:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  code={`
:TSInstall eclair
`}
/>

Now you should have syntax highlighting for any file with the ".eclair" extension!

## Language Server

Eclair provides a built-in LSP server via the `lsp` subcommand. Currently it
supports the following features:

1. Show compiler errors directly from your editor
2. Return type information of a value
3. Highlight uses of a variable (references)

The LSP can be started as follows:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  code={`
$ export DATALOG_dir=/path/to/eclair/cbits/
$ eclair lsp
`}
/>

**Note:** For now, the environment variable `$DATALOG_DIR` needs to be set and
point to the `cbits/` directory of the eclair repository. This is only
temporary until the compiler is bootstrapped (then the whole compiler will
become a single binary).

### Neovim

The Eclair LSP can be setup using the
[nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) package. (The LSP is
not available via [Mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim) yet, so
it has to be installed with manual code.)

<CodeBlock
  language="lua"
  code={`
local lsp_util = require("lspconfig.util")

require('lspconfig.configs').eclair = {
  default_config = {
    cmd = { 'eclair', 'lsp' },
    filetypes = { 'eclair' },
    root_dir = lsp_util.find_git_ancestor,
    single_file_support = true,
  }
}

require('lspconfig').eclair.setup {}

-- NOTE: Also add keybindings for LSP functionality.
-- (See nvim-lspconfig docs.)
`}
/>

Then try to open a file with the ".eclair" extension and try typing some code.
You should start to see live feedback from the compiler.

title: Introduction to Datalog
section: Getting started
order: 3
---

If you have mostly been working with "mainstream programming languages", Eclair
(and Datalog in general) might look foreign to you in terms of both the syntax
and how these languages work under the hood. If this is the case, don't worry!
Datalog is a very minimal language and can be learned quickly.

Below are some links to introductory articles that explain some of the
foundational concepts and ideas that Datalog is based on. One thing to note is
that because there are _several_ variants of Datalog, the syntax used in these
articles might differ from Eclair's syntax, but the ideas stay the same. If
there is a big difference compared to how Eclair works, this will be pointed
out.

- The [Wikipedia entry for Datalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog)
  gives a good introduction to what Datalog is, the semantics of the language
  and how results are calculated. Note that Eclair handles queries differently:
  rules need to be marked as [outputs](/docs/language-reference/#type-definitions)
  for Eclair to compute and return the results.
- [Introduction to Datalog](https://x775.net/2019/03/18/Introduction-to-Datalog.html)
  is a great blogpost that explains many of the ideas in Datalog step by step
  with several examples. Keep in mind though that in Eclair facts and rules
  need to be explicitly marked if they are used as an
  [input or output](/docs/language-reference/#type-definitions).
- Chapters 12 to 15 of [Foundation of Databases (a.k.a. Alice's book)](http://webdam.inria.fr/Alice/)
  focus on Datalog. It gives a more theoretical foundation and formalizes the
  concepts used in the language.
- [Guide for writing Datalog fact extractors](https://luctielen.com/posts/guide_for_writing_datalog_fact_extractors/)
  is a blogpost written by Luc Tielen, the creator of Eclair. The guide is focused on
  how to prepare a dataset for analysis with Soufflé Datalog, but the same
  approach works for Eclair as well.
- [Static analysis using Haskell and Datalog](https://luctielen.com/posts/static_analysis_using_haskell_and_datalog/)
  is another tutorial on Luc's blog. This post focuses again on doing analysis
  with Soufflé, but you can do the same for Eclair if you make use of the
  [eclair-haskell library](https://github.com/luc-tielen/eclair-haskell).
  (The code will almost be exactly the same on the Haskell side!)

This page contains an overview of all the current features in Eclair and their
corresponding syntax.

## Declarations

A program consists of zero or more top-level declarations.
Declarations can be [type definitions](#type-definitions), [atoms](#atoms),
[rules](#rules) or [extern definitions](#extern-definitions).
Together, they can be used to describe logical queries that Eclair will search
for in a given dataset.

Syntactically, a period (`.`) is used to mark the end of each declaration.

### Type definitions

Before you can use a _relation_ in a [atom](#atoms) or [rule](#rules), you
will first need to declare them. A type definition consists of the name of the
relation, along with the [types](#primitive-types) of each of their arguments.
Note that a relation requires always at least one argument.

Besides the name of the relation and its arguments, you can also specify if the
relation is meant to be used as an `input`, `output`, as both `input` and
`output`.

**Important**: If you do not add any usage qualifier, Eclair will assume the
relation is only used internally. If you then try to add data or retrieve
results from an internal relation, Eclair will do _nothing_ (because no code for
this functionality would have been generated).

Below are some example type definitions:

<CodeBlock
  language="eclair"
  code={`
@def input_example(arg1: u32) input.
@def output_example(arg1: string, arg2: u32) output.
@def input_output(arg1: string) input output.
@def internal_relation(arg1: string).
`}
/>

### Atoms

Once a relation is defined, it can be used as an _atom_. Atoms can appear
either directly as a top-level declaration, or inside a [rule](#rules).
A top-level atom is also referred to as _fact_. When an atom is used inside the
body of a rule, they are referred to as a _(rule) clause_.

An atom consists of the name of the relation, followed by one or more arguments.
Note that for top-level atoms, it is only allowed to use constant literals for
one of the arguments; [variables](#variables) or [wildcards](#wildcards) are
not allowed. The snippet below shows examples of some facts:

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={
`
@def person(first_name: string, last_name: string, age: u32).
@def siblings(first_sibling: string, second_sibling: string).

person("John", "Doe", 30).
person("Jane", "Doe", 27).

siblings("John", "Jane").
`
} />

In the next section about [rules](#rules), more examples will be given how to
use atoms inside rule bodies.

Besides facts defined directly in Eclair code, it is also possible to use the
[Eclair API](/docs/api) to insert _input_ facts or retrieve _output_ facts dynamically.

### Rules

Besides [atoms](#atoms), relations can also be used in rules. Rules can be used
to describe what patterns to search for in a dataset.

A rule consists of a _rule head_ and a _rule body_ consisting of one or more
_rule clauses_. The syntax for a rule is as follows:

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={
`
rule_head(arg1, arg2) :-
  clause1(arg1, arg2),
  // ...
  clauseN(arg1).
`
} />

Eclair will evaluate the above rule as follows:

1. For each of the rule clauses in the rule body: check if a matching atom can
   be found,
2. If this is the case, add the relation with the values in the rule head to
   the query results.

Multiple clauses are separated by a comma (`,`). This forms a logical
conjunction (_AND_) of the clauses (all clauses need to be satisfied for the
rule to true).

Besides conjunction, it is also possible to create a logical disjunction (_OR_)
with rules. You can do this by writing down two or more rules, each with
different rule bodies:

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={
`
rule_head(arg1, arg2) :-
  // rule body 1...

rule_head(arg1, arg2) :-
  // rule body 2...
`
} />

In this scenario, the rule head will be added to the query results if one of
the two rule bodies is satisfied.

Clauses can be negated (logical _NOT_) by prepending a exclamation mark (`!`)
to a clause. Eclair will then look if that clause is not satisfied. An example
of negation can be found below:

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={
`
rule_head(arg1, arg2) :-
  clause1(arg1, arg2),
  !clause2(arg2).
`
} />

Negation has additional constraints to guarantee that the program is
well-structured and will terminate. More information regarding logical negation
in rules can be found [here](/docs/negation).

Rules can be recursive (this happens when the relation in the rule head also
appears in the rule body). Eclair will use [bottom-up
evaluation](/docs/bottom-up-evaluation) to iteratively look for results until
no new information can be deduced. An example of a recursive query can be found
below. It makes use of two rules to find all reachable vertices in a graph:

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={
`
@def edge(from: u32, to: u32) input.
@def reachable(start: u32, end: u32) output.

// 2 points are reachable iff
// there is a direct edge between those points.
reachable(x, y) :-
  edge(x, y).

// 2 points are reachable iff
// there is a direct edge between a point x and a third point z,
// AND point y is reachable from point z
reachable(x, y) :-
  edge(x, z),
  reachable(z, y).
`
} />

### Extern definitions

Eclair has support for linking against functions defined in another language.
This is possible via _extern definitions_ (also called _user-defined functions_).
This helps keep the language small while still being extendable.

User-defined functions do not [ground](/docs/grounding) any of their arguments,
but they *do* ground their return value if all arguments were also grounded.

Extern definitions are declared in Eclair via the `@extern` keyword, followed
by the name of the function and one or more arguments, possibly followed by a
return type. The snippet below shows an example of how to use extern
definitions in Eclair:

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={
`
@extern my_function(u32) u32.
@extern my_constraint(u32).
@def rule(u32).
@def fact(u32).

rule(x) :-
  fact(x),
  y = my_function(x),
  my_constraint(y).
`
} />

You can find more detailed information about user-defined
functions [here](/docs/user-defined-functions).

## Primitive types

Eclair currently has support for the 32-bit [unsigned integers](#integers) and
[string](#strings) primitive types. Other types such as signed integers are
planned and will be added in the future.

### Integers

Integer literals should be written down in decimal form. Integer arguments in
[type definitions](#type-definitions) are specified with the `u32` keyword.
The following snippet shows the syntax for using integers:

<CodeBlock
  language="eclair"
  code={`
@def coordinate(x: u32, y: u32).

coordinate(3, 7).
coordinate(8, 4).
`}
/>

Integers can be used in both [arithmetic expressions](#arithmetic) or
[comparisons](#comparisons).

### Strings

String literals in Eclair start and end with a double-quote (`"`) and can
contain zero or more characters. String arguments in [type
definitions](#type-definitions) are specified with the `string` keyword. The
code below is a small example of how you can use string literals:

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={
`
@def book(title: string).

book("Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs").
book("7 languages in 7 weeks").
`
} />

Internally, strings are stored as UTF-8-encoded bytearrays with a known length.
They do not have a 0-terminator like in C.

Eclair only provides very minimal functionality for strings in the form of
[(in-)equality comparisons](#comparisons). This is done to keep the language
small. If you do need extra functionality (e.g. regex support), you can add
this functionality with [user-defined functions](/docs/user-defined-functions).

## Variables

Eclair supports the use of variables inside rules. Unlike most languages,
variables do not need to be declared up front. Instead you can simply start
using them in a rule, and Eclair will generate the necessary code to properly
initialize the variables.

If a variable occurs multiple times in a single rule body, an implicit equality
check is added to make sure the variables are equal. The code below shows an
example where this is used to find 3 consecutive links that form a chain:

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={
`
chain(first, last) :-
  link(first, second),
  link(second, third),
  link(third, last).
`
} />

Variables always start with a letter and are followed by zero or more
alpha-numeric or underscore characters.

Variables are only allowed in [rules](#rules) (both in the rule body and rule
head), not in [facts](#atoms). In order for Eclair to generate valid code,
variables need to be [grounded](/docs/grounding).

### Wildcards

Wildcards are a special kind of variable that you can use in Eclair when you
_don't care_ about a specific argument value in a rule clause. A wildcard
variable unifies with every value. The syntax for a wildcard is a single
underscore (`_`). The code below shows how you could use wildcards to ignore
some arguments in a fact:

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={
`
@def person(name: string, age: u32).
@def person_name(name: string).

person*name(name) :-
person(name, *).
`
} />

Contrary to regular variables, when a rule body contains more than two
wildcards, they will **not** unify with each other. In other words, each
wildcard is treated as a unique variable. The following example shows how the
compiler would rewrite a rule containing multiple wildcards:

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={
`
rule(x) :-
  fact1(x, _),
  fact2(x, y, _).

// will be rewritten as:

rule(x) :-
  fact1(x, wildcard_var1),
  fact2(x, y, wildcard_var2).
`
} />

Wildcards are not allowed in rule heads or in arithmetic expressions; they are
only allowed as arguments of rule clauses. This restriction is necessary to
make sure the program can be properly compiled.

### Typed holes

Typed holes (also referred to as just _holes_) represent a piece of Eclair code
that is _unfinished_. They make it possible to have a valid Eclair program that
is not fully thought out yet, but that the compiler can still reason about.

Holes are allowed in any location in a rule body where expressions (literal
values or variables) are allowed. The syntax for a typed hole is a single
question mark (`?`).

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={
`
reachable(x, y) :-
  edge(x, ?),
  reachable(z, y).

fact(?).

rule(x) :-
  x = ?,
  fact(x).
`
} />

When you use a typed hole, you can ask the Eclair compiler to show you the
type-level information that it deduced at that location in the program. This
can be useful to help figuring out type errors in your program. For more
information about typed holes, check out the
[typesystem documentation](/docs/typesystem).

## Operators

Eclair provides built-in operators for doing [arithmetic](#arithmetic) or
[comparing values](#comparisons). The following sections provide more
information on where these operators are allowed and how they can be used.

### Comparisons

Eclair supports built-in operators for comparing 2 values. These can be divided
into equality constraints (`=` and `!=`), and inequality comparisons (`<`,
`<=`, `>` and `>=`). Equality constraints are supported on all types. The
comparison operators are supported only on integer values.

**Important**: the equality operator has different behavior compared to most
other languages! In Eclair, equality is actual mathematical equality; it is
_not_ an assignment of a variable. This means that when you write `x = 3`, you
are saying that `x` equals to `3`. (On a side note, this means you can also
write `3 = x`.) Besides this, the equality operator also plays an important
rule in [grounding variables](/docs/grounding).

The code below shows how comparisons can be used in Eclair.

<CodeBlock
  language="eclair"
  code={`
rule(x) :-
  fact(x),
  x < 10,
  x >= 3,
  x != 7.
`}
/>

Comparison operators can only appear in a rule body. Only one comparison is
possible per clause, compound in-equality comparisons are not supported.

### Arithmetic

Eclair supports arithmetic operators found in most other languages. For now
the supported operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`. In the future more
operators will be added (bitwise operators, logical operators, ...).

Operators can be used in any rule clause and even in the rule head, as long as
both arguments of the binary operation are [grounded](/docs/grounding).

Expressions with arithmetic operators can be nested, and have the same
precedence rules as in math. Parentheses can be used to override the order
in which sub-expressions are evaluated.

The snippet below showcases how you can use arithmetic operators:

<CodeBlock
  language="eclair"
  code={`
rule(x + y) :-
  fact1(x),
  fact2(y + 5 * 7),
  y = (1 + 8) / 3 * 4.
`}
/>

Arithmetic operations are only supported on integers. If you want to do e.g.
string concatenation (commonly done with `+` in other languages), then you will
need to create a [user-defined function](#user-defined-functions) that
implements this behavior.

## Comments

Comments in Eclair have the same syntax as C-style languages. They can appear
anywhere in the code. Single-line comments are prefixed with `//` and continue
until the end of the current line. Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end
with `*/` and can span multiple lines. Below is a snippet of Eclair code with
some comments:

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={
`
// A single line comment

/*
A comment
spanning
multiple lines.
*/
`
} />

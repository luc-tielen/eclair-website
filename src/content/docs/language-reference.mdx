This page contains an overview of all the current features in Eclair and their
corresponding syntax.

## Declarations

A program consists of zero or more top-level declarations.
Declarations can be [type definitions](#type-definitions), [atoms](#atoms),
[rules](#rules) or [extern definitions](#extern-definitions).
Together, they can be used to describe logical queries that Eclair will search
for in a given dataset.

Syntactically, a period (`.`) is used to mark the end of each declaration.

### Type definitions

Before you can use a _relation_ in a [atom](#atoms) or [rule](#rules), you
will first need to declare them. A type definition consists of the name of the
relation, along with the [types](#primitive-types) of each of their arguments.
Note that a relation requires always at least one argument.

Besides the name of the relation and its arguments, you can also specify if the
relation is meant to be used as an `input`, `output`, as both `input` and
`output`.

**Important**: If you do not add any usage qualifier, Eclair will assume the
relation is only used internally. If you then try to add data or retrieve
results from an internal relation, Eclair will do _nothing_ (because no code for
this functionality would have been generated).

Below are some example type definitions:

<CodeBlock
  language="eclair"
  code={`
@def input_example(arg1: u32) input.
@def output_example(arg1: string, arg2: u32) output.
@def input_output(arg1: string) input output.
@def internal_relation(arg1: string).
`}
/>

### Atoms

Once a relation is defined, it can be used as an _atom_. Atoms can appear
either directly as a top-level declaration, or inside a [rule](#rules).
A top-level atom is also referred to as _fact_. When an atom is used inside the
body of a rule, they are referred to as a _(rule) clause_.

An atom consists of the name of the relation, followed by one or more arguments.
Note that for top-level atoms, it is only allowed to use constant literals for
one of the arguments; [variables](#variables) or [wildcards](#wildcards) are
not allowed. The snippet below shows examples of some facts:

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={
`
@def person(first_name: string, last_name: string, age: u32).
@def siblings(first_sibling: string, second_sibling: string).

person("John", "Doe", 30).
person("Jane", "Doe", 27).

siblings("John", "Jane").
`
} />

In the next section about [rules](#rules), more examples will be given how to
use atoms inside rule bodies.

Besides facts defined directly in Eclair code, it is also possible to use the
[Eclair API](/docs/api) to insert _input_ facts or retrieve _output_ facts dynamically.

### Rules

Besides atoms, relations can also be used in rules.

TODO what does rule consist of, recursive rules, joins (and), disjunction, explain negation (link to negation doc)

The following code snippet shows how you can use rules to find all reachable vertices in a graph:

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={
`
@def edge(from: u32, to: u32) input.
@def reachable(start: u32, end: u32) output.

reachable(x, y) :-
  edge(x, y).

reachable(x, y) :-
  edge(x, z),
  reachable(z, y).
`
} />

### Extern definitions

## Primitive types

Eclair has support for both unsigned 32-bit integers and strings. TODO finish this..

### Integers

Eclair has support for 32-bit unsigned integers.

<CodeBlock
  language="eclair"
  code={`
123
`}
/>

### Strings

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={`TODO`} />

## Variables

### Wildcards

### Typed holes

Typed holes (also referred to as just _holes_) represent a piece of Eclair code
that is _unfinished_. They make it possible to have a valid Eclair program that
is not fully thought out yet, but that the compiler can still reason about.

Holes are allowed in any location in a rule body where expressions (literal
values or variables) are allowed. The syntax for a typed hole is a single
question mark (`?`).

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={
`
reachable(x, y) :-
 edge(x, ?),
 reachable(z, y).

fact(?).

rule(x) :-
  x = ?,
  fact(x).
`
} />

When you use a typed hole, you can ask the Eclair compiler to show you the
type-level information that it deduced at that location in the program. This
can be useful to help figuring out type errors in your program. For more
information about typed holes, check out the
[typesystem documentation](/docs/typesystem).

## Operators

TODO constraints, comparisons, where allowed, ...

## Comments

Comments in Eclair have the same syntax as C-style languages. They can appear
anywhere in the code. Single-line comments are prefixed with `//` and continue
until the end of the current line. Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end
with `*/` and can span multiple lines. Below is a snippet of Eclair code with
some comments:

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={
`
// A single line comment

/*
A comment
spanning
multiple lines.
*/
`
} />

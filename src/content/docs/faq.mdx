  <dt class="font-medium">What license does Eclair have?</dt>
  <dd>
    The Eclair compiler itself is licensed under a BSD-3 license, a permissive
    open-source license. You can find the license
    [here](https://github.com/luc-tielen/eclair-lang/blob/main/LICENSE). Note
    that the license only applies to the compiler; you are free to license the
    generated code however you see fit.
  </dd>
  <dt class="font-medium">Where does the name come from?</dt>
  <dd>
    Eclair is heavily inspired by [Soufflé](https://souffle-lang.github.io),
    another high-performance Datalog that compiles to C++. Because of the
    similarities, another kind of pastry was chosen to stay in the same food
    theme. Besides, an eclair contains both chocolate and pudding, what's not to
    like?
  </dd>
  <dt class="font-medium">Can I use Eclair by itself?</dt>
  <dd>
    No, Eclair is not a general purpose programming language; it's only made for
    querying data. Eclair will always depend on another _"host"_ language for
    interacting with the outside world, just like when you would write an
    application that makes use of SQL. You can start using Eclair from another
    language by making use of one of the provided [language
    bindings](/docs/getting-started#language-support).
  </dd>
  <dt class="font-medium">What languages is Eclair itself written in?</dt>
  <dd>
    The Eclair compiler is written in a mix of Haskell and Datalog. Using higher
    level languages makes the code easier to maintain, adapt and extend. The
    [LLVM compiler framework](https://llvm.org) is used for achieving fast query
    times.
  </dd>
  <dt class="font-medium">What architectures are supported by Eclair?</dt>
  <dd>
    Because Eclair compiles to LLVM IR, any supported architecture by LLVM is a
    possible compilation target for Eclair. Eclair can compile both to native
    machine code or WebAssembly, which means you can run it almost anywhere!
  </dd>
  <dt class="font-medium">Why is there no direct support for 64-bit integers?</dt>
  <dd>
    Eclair runs its queries 100% in-memory (RAM), and uses datastructures that
    are optimized to use as little memory as possible. Internally, this means
    that everything is represented by 32-bit integers. Using 64-bit integers
    would roughly double the RAM usage for a query (and perform slower too!).

    In practice, the lack of 64-bit integers usually doesn't end up being a
    problem for search-based problems, or you could use some simple workarounds.
    If you do encounter a situation where a _64-bit mode_ would help considerably,
    consider opening an [issue on Github](https://github.com/luc-tielen/eclair-website/issues).

Eclair has support for invoking user-defined or external functions defined in
another programming language. This makes it possible to add functionality to
the language, without having to change Eclair itself. This helps keep the
language small.

User-defined functions are introduced with the `@extern` keyword. For those of
you familiar with C or C++, it is conceptually very similar to `extern` functions.
Extern functions can be used either as a constraint, or as a plain function which
returns a result. The syntax looks as follows:

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={
`
// External function used as a constraint
@extern CONSTRAINT_NAME(TYPE+).

// External function used as a function
// The final type at the end is the return type of the function.
@extern FUNCTION_NAME(TYPE+) TYPE.
`
} />

Extern functions defined as a constraint can be used in the body of a rule,
just like a normal relational atom. They can't be used as constant top-level
facts though. If an external function is defined as a plain function with a
return type, then it can be used in any place where an expression is allowed.
The compiler verifies that external constraints and functions are used only in
places where they are allowed.

An important thing to note is that user-defined functions do _not_ ground
variables used in their arguments. If you use a variable in a user-defined
function, you will also have to ground the variable by using it in an atom
or by assigning a constant to it.

## Compiling and linking external definitions

Before we write our own externally defined functions, we first need to
understand the conventions that Eclair uses under the hood with a simple
example:

<CodeBlock
  language="eclair"
  code={`
@extern my_constraint(u32, u32).
@extern my_function(string) string.
`}
/>

When you compile the Eclair code listed above, it will generate the following
function declarations somewhere in the final LLVM IR:

<CodeBlock
  language="llvm"
  code={`
// NOTE: LLVM doesn't care about signedness, only about the size of each value
declare external ccc i1 @my_constraint(%symbol_table*, i32, i32)
declare external ccc i32 @my_function(%symbol_table*, i32)
`}
/>

In C the generated IR would be equivalent to:

<CodeBlock
  language="c"
  code={`
struct symbol_table;

extern bool my_constraint(struct symbol_table*, uint32_t, uint32_t);
extern uint32_t my_function(struct symbol_table*, uint32_t);
`}
/>

From this we can conclude the following rules when writing user-defined
functions:

1. User-defined functions need to be written in a language that is compatible
   with the C ABI.
2. Each argument in Eclair is replaced with a 32-bit integer. This is also true
   for strings, since they are internally mapped to 32-bit integers.
3. The return type of functions is also replaced with a 32-bit integer for the
   same reason.
4. Every user-defined function is passed a pointer to the
   [symbol table](/runtime/symbol_table) managed by the Eclair runtime. Strings
   have to be manually looked up or inserted in the table.
5. Constraints have a bool return type, even though this is not visible in
   the Eclair code itself. A return value of `true` / `1` indicates the
   function / predicate succeeded, otherwise `false` / `0` should be returned.

Besides these rules, you should also take the following things into account:

1. Functions should be deterministic, and always return the same value for the
   same set of function arguments.
2. Functions are only allowed to access the Eclair runtime via the provided
   API functions, and should not modify or read values directly from the
   internal data-structures.
3. No assumptions can be made on how many times a user-defined function is
   invoked. (This is heavily dependent on how Eclair optimizes the code.)
4. These functions are invoked _many_ times in a hot-code path, so care should
   be taken to write efficient / fast code.

These are a lot of rules and considerations, but it's to be expected since we
are integrating so tightly with the language runtime.

### Compiling and linking with C

The following set of commands is how you can compile and statically link
user-defined functions in C against Eclair code:

<CodeBlock
  language="bash"
  code={`
$ eclair compile my_code.eclair --emit llvm > my_code.ll
# Scenario 1: separate library that contains the user-defined functions
$ clang -c lib.c -o lib.o
$ ar rcs libudf.a lib.o
$ clang -o program main.c libudf.a my_code.ll
# Scenario 2: the binary that calls into Eclair directly contains
# the user-defined functions
$ clang -o program main.c my_code.ll
`}
/>

This is the basic set of commands, but you can choose to add extra compiler
flags as needed. For example: If you enable `-flto`, you can get extra
whole-program optimizations.

### Compiling and linking with other languages

Eclair can also be linked with other languages, as long as they provide a way of
generating C ABI compatible code.

The rough outline of what you will need to do is:

1. Compile the Eclair program to LLVM IR;
2. Compile your language of choice to a binary object, static archive, or LLVM IR;
3. Link everything together into one executable.

## Examples

### Regex matching

The following is an example of how constraints could be used to add
regex-matching functionality to Eclair.

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={
`
// Assume this function
@extern match(string, string).

@def full_name(string).
@def matching_name(string) output.

full_name("John Doe").
full_name("Jane Doe").
full_name("John Smith").

matching_name(name) :-
   full_name(name),
   match(name, ".\*Doe").
`
} />

### Complex calculations

Another example that uses functions to calculate complex expressions:

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={
`
@extern my_function(u32, u32) u32.

@def value(u32) input.
@def result(u32) output.

result(z) :-
   y = 123,
   z = my_function(y, x),
   value(x).
`
} />

## Future work

A "standard library" for Eclair is planned in the future (most likely as a
Rust library), to provide functionality for strings, regexes, complex
arithmetic, ...

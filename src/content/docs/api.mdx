title: Eclair runtime API
---

import CodeBlock from "../../components/CodeBlock.tsx";

Eclair is meant to be embedded and controlled from inside another _host
language_. It exposes a tiny API that allows you to do all the high level
operations:

1. [Initializing the Eclair runtime](#initializing-the-eclair-runtime),
2. [Serializing data from host language to Eclair](#serializing-data-from-host-language-to-eclair),
3. [Running the Eclair program](#running-an-eclair-program),
4. [Deserializing results from Eclair back to the host language](#deserializing-data-from-eclair-back-to-the-host-language),
5. [Cleanup / teardown of the Eclair runtime](#cleanup-of-the-eclair-runtime).

Note that the types of the API functions mentioned below are written down in C
just as an indication, it's also completely possible to call these functions
from JavaScript-based languages if Eclair code is compiled to WebAssembly for
example.

Eclair exposes a lot of low-level internal details in it's runtime API, giving
a developer a lot of control over how they want to use Eclair. This comes at a
cost though: it's easier to make mistakes and introduce bugs. For this reason,
[high-level language bindings](/docs/invoking-code#integrating-with-other-languages)
exist that make integrating with Eclair code a much easier task. Or you can
[use the low level API directly](/docs/invoking-code#c).

## Initializing the Eclair runtime

Before you can call any of the other functions in Eclair, it's important that
you first initialize the runtime. This can be done by invoking the
`eclair_program_init` function:

<CodeBlock language="c" code={`
struct program;

struct program* eclair_program_init();
`}/>

The function returns an opaque pointer (a "handle" to the Eclair program). The
rest of the API always requires this pointer to be passed in as the first
argument.

## Serializing data from host language to Eclair

Now that the runtime is initialized, you can start serializing data from your
host language to Eclair. The language provides a couple of functions to add one
or more facts:

<CodeBlock language="c" code={`
void eclair_add_fact(
  struct program* program,
  uint32_t fact_type,
  uint32_t* fact_data
);

void eclair_add_facts(
  struct program* program,
  uint32_t fact_type,
  uint32_t* fact_data,
  uint32_t fact_count
);
`}/>

One thing might immediately stand out: Eclair only accepts an array of
`uint32_t` data. This is done for two reasons:

1. Eclair only uses `uint32_t` internally to represent data (for both
   performance and simplicity),
2. It's better for performance when communicating data back and forth, since we
   only need to do a single function call into Eclair with a single contiguous
   array.

The fact array should be filled with data of one fact directly followed by
the next. For example, given this Eclair program:

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={`
@def edge(u32, u32) input.
`}/>

If you wanted to push `edge(1, 2)` and `edge(2, 3)` into Eclair, you would need
to create an array of this shape:

<CodeBlock language="c" code={`
uint32_t fact_data[] = {
  1, 2,
  3, 4
};
`}/>

If you have facts that contain data that is not a `uint32_t` (e.g. a string
value), you will need to first encode the string in Eclair. This can be done
with the `eclair_encode_string` function that takes both the length of the
string and a pointer to a byte-array (Eclair assumes UTF-8 encoding):

<CodeBlock language="c" code={`
uint32_t eclair_encode_string(
  struct program*,
  uint32_t string_length,
  const char* string_data
);
`}/>

The function returns a `uint32_t` value that represents the string, that you
can insert at the right location into the fact array.

One final thing to point out about `eclair_add_fact` and `eclair_add_facts` is
the `fact_type` argument. In order to get the value for this argument, you will
need to call `eclair_encode_string` with the name of the relation, to get the
corresponding fact type value back.

## Running an Eclair program

Once you have serialized all your input facts into Eclair, you can now run your
program. This is done by invoking the `eclair_program_run` function:

<CodeBlock language="c" code={`
void eclair_program_run(struct program*);
`}/>

This will run the Eclair Datalog program from start to end and calculate all
derived facts.

## Deserializing data from Eclair back to the host language

Deserializing the data back into the host language is similar to serialization
of data. Eclair works here also with a single `uint32_t` array of data. For
deserialization a few more helper functions are required to process the
returned array of data. The functions related to deserialization are the following:

<CodeBlock language="c" code={`
uint32_t eclair_fact_count(
  struct program*,
  uint32_t fact_type
);

uint32_t* eclair_get_facts(
  struct program*,
  uint32_t fact_type
);

void eclair_free_buffer(uint32_t* data);
`}/>

`eclair_fact_count` returns the total amount of facts returned for a relation,
while `eclair_get_facts` returns the actual array containing fact data.
`eclair_free_buffer` is needed since the returned `uint32_t`-array is
dynamically allocated on the heap and needs to be manually freed by the host
language after it is no longer needed.

These 3 functions allow you to write the following code for processing fact
results in the host language:

<CodeBlock language="c" code={`
uint32_t fact_count = eclair_fact_count(program, fact_type);
uint32_t* data = eclair_get_facts(program, fact_Type);

for (uint32_t i = 0; i < fact_count; i++) {
   // Process each fact in the array here.
   // Be sure to index the facts in the array properly!
}

eclair_free_buffer(data);
`}/>

If you have string values inside your fact data, you will manually need to
call `eclair_decode_string` to go from the `uint32_t` value back to the
underlying string byte-array. The signature of this function is as follows:

<CodeBlock language="c" code={`
struct symbol {
  uint32_t length;
  const char* data;
};

struct symbol* eclair_decode_string(
  struct program*,
  uint32_t string_index
);
`}/>

The returned symbol does _not_ need to be freed, this will happen
automatically when the Eclair program is shutdown (see next section).

If you pass in a string index that is not internally used by Eclair, you will
get back a `NULL` pointer because the symbol could not be found. Always check
if the returned symbol is valid.

## Cleanup of the Eclair runtime

Once you are finished using Eclair, you need to shutdown the runtime. This is a
required manual operation since Eclair has no garbage collector and performs
manual memory management under the hood.

Eclair provides a single function for this:

<CodeBlock language="c" code={`
void eclair_program_destroy(struct program*);
`} />

Calling this function will free up any memory still in use by Eclair, so that
the system can use it for other purposes. After this point it's no longer valid
to call other functions of the API.

## Allocating memory

When compiling for the WebAssembly target, Eclair also needs to expose `malloc`
and `free` for allocating memory inside the `WebAssembly.Memory` buffer. These
functions are exposed as `eclair_malloc` and `eclair_free` and have the same
function signatures as the libc counterpart:

<CodeBlock language="c" code={`
void* eclair_malloc(uint32_t num_bytes);
void  eclair_free(void* pointer);
`}/>


Each time you need to push an array of data into Eclair (e.g. when adding facts
or serializing a string), you first need to do a call to `eclair_malloc` and use
the returned address to fill the WebAssembly memory buffer with data. After the
data is pushed into Eclair and is no longer in use, the data needs to be freed
with `eclair_free`.

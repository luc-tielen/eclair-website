Eclair is a statically typed language, meaning that all types are known at
compilation time. As part of the compilation process, Eclair checks the types
of all values in a program to ensure it is valid. The rest of this page
describes how the typesystem works.

## Types in a program

### Primitive types

At the moment, Eclair supports two primitive types: `string` (UTF-8 encoded
strings) and `u32` (unsigned 32-bit integers). Note that there is no support
for signed 32-bit integers yet, but this will be added in the future.

### Literals and operators

The type of literals can be inferred based on their syntax. This is due to the
fact that [integers](/docs/language-reference#integers) have different syntax
compared to [strings](/docs/language-reference#strings).

Operators are built in to the language and have pre-defined types. Arithmetic
operators and comparisons are only supported on integers. Both left- and
right-hand-side arguments need to be an integer type, and return an
integer-typed value as well. Equality operators (`=` and `!=`) are supported
on all primitive types.

### Variables

Variables can be used in rule clauses as arguments to a relation, in a
comparison or equality constraint.

The type of a variable is based on how it is used inside a rule. When a
variable is used in a rule for the first time, Eclair will assign a type to
the variable. If the same variable is later used again in the same rule, then
the previously assigned type is checked against the current expected type.

When variables are used in a relation or externally defined function or
constraint, they are checked against the corresponding argument in the
definition.

When a variable is used in a comparison or equality operator, Eclair tries to
infer the type of the variable based on either the operator itself, or on the
other argument used in the operator. If Eclair fails to determine the types of
one or more variables in a rule, an error is thrown and compilation is aborted.

[Wildcards](/docs/language-reference#wildcards) are treated the same as
variables, but with the main difference that each wildcard is treated as a
unique variable. (Two wildcards can have different types, unlike variables of
the same name.)

### Typed holes

[Typed holes](/docs/language-reference#typed-holes) are _placeholders_ for a
part of the program that is not complete yet. They can be very useful when you
are writing your program and still figuring out part of logical rule, or when
debugging if you want to know more information about the types of values in a
function.

For example, given the function below:

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={`
@def edge(u32, u32) input.
@def reachable(u32, u32) output.

reachable(x, z) :-
  edge(x, ?),  // <-- typed hole here
  reachable(y, z).
`} />

When you try to compile this Eclair program (try it out!), the compiler will
give you an error message listing all possible candidate variables.

The typesystem treats each typed hole as a unique variable.
Depending how it is used (in a rule or in an equality clause), the compiler
will try to figure out the best matching type for the hole. After this, it
collects all information about the rest of the types in a fact or rule and
presents the information in an error message.

### Relations

Relations (both facts and rules) contain one or more arguments. Each of these
arguments needs to have the type declared up front. The typesystem uses this
information to later check the type of a value against this expected type.

Relations do not have any return type and so cannot be used in e.g. arithmetic
expressions or equality constraints.

As an example, in the following snippet "relation" is a relation that consists
of a `string` and `u32` value:

<CodeBlock language="eclair" code={`
@def relation(string, u32).
`}/>

### External definitions

From the point of view of the typechecker, [external
definitions](/docs/user-defined-functions) are handled similar to
[relations](#relations).

The main difference is that externally defined functions (those defined with a
return type), **can** be used in arithmetic expressions and equality
constraints.

## Typesystem rules

The following is a description in plain English how the typechecker checks an
Eclair program:

1. The typechecker first collects all type-level information about relations
   and external definitions.
2. Afterwards, it checks the types of each top level declaration (facts and
   rules) independently.
3. Values in a top-level fact are checked from left to right.
4. Values in a top-level rule are checked from left to right, and from top
   to bottom.
5. All relations or externally defined functions need to be defined.
6. The number of arguments used in a fact or rule is checked against the
   definition. An error is reported if it does not match the expected number of
   arguments.
7. If type-level information is available (e.g. when using a variable as an
   argument to a relation), then the value will be checked against that type.
   Otherwise the type will be inferred. Type inference of values is scoped to a
   single rule.
8. A user-defined function can't be used in a location where a relation or
   user-defined constraint is expected, and vice versa.
9. Each primitive type is treated as a distinct type. You will get a
   type-mismatch error if you use a string value where an integer is expected
   and vice versa.
10. The type of literals is inferred.
11. Arguments passed to operators are checked against their pre-defined types.
    Arguments passed to equality constraints are inferred to see if both
    arguments have the same types. A type-mismatch or unification error will be
    raised if an inconsistency is detected.
12. A typed hole will always raise a type error to show the type information
    the compiler deduced for that rule.

If no errors are found while checking all these rules, the program is
considered to be valid with respect to the types.

## Future work

For now the typesystem is still relatively simple, but it will be extended
to support polymorphic relations (for code reuse), support for other
primitive types, user-defined types, ... Stay tuned! ðŸ˜Š
